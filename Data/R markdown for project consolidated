## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
hospitaldataoriginal <- read.csv("C:\Users\payde\Desktop\Homework and data sets\HospitalDurations.csv")

hospitaldata <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\payde\\Desktop\\Homework and data sets\\HospitalDurations (1).csv")
#recreated data with categorical variables: med school affiliate is 0=no 1=yes


#na explore 
sum(is.na(hospitaldata))
#no NA's found. 
```

##Plots with color palette
```{r}

hosp_color <- c("#609175", "#21295C", "#1B3B6F", "#6F7273", "#DCEDFF")

ggpairs(hospitaldata,
        title = "Correlation Scatterplot Matrix",
        lower = list(continuous = wrap("smooth", color = hosp_color[1])), # Apply custom color to lower panels
        diag = list(continuous = wrap("densityDiag", fill = hosp_color[2])), # Apply custom color to diagonal panels
        upper = list(continuous = wrap("cor", color = hosp_color[3]))) # Apply custom color to upper panels
```
